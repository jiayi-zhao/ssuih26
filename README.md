```
The output can be generated by sending the following requests by curl
```
curl -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5fQ.aA3dJ7sMtirNFjK9rucW09MDq6U8Mkmsl6FNDY4DzRI" http://localhost:3001
```
Note the authorization is a JSON hased code generated within the server where the browerse 
get such information and send the request with the header's authorization token every time.
The above token is generated by
```
JWT.encode({user_id: 9, 'jiayi')
```
With the same token specified, it is impossible to do the following requests
```
GET /users/
GET /users/8
```
