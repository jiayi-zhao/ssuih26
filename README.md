# Detailed Functionality and Testing

## Parent

In the following examples, we will use user 9 of type parent to illustrate the example result.

The authorization is a JSON hashed code generated within the server where the browerse 
get such information and send the request with the header's authorization token every time.
The user 9 authorization token is generated by a user 9 of type parent
```
JWT.encode({user_id: 9, 'jiayi')
```

### GET /users/:id

The output can be generated by sending the following requests by curl
```
curl -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5fQ.aA3dJ7sMtirNFjK9rucW09MDq6U8Mkmsl6FNDY4DzRI" http://localhost:3001/users/9
```
It is however impossible to do the following requests and the api will return {}
```
GET /users
curl -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5fQ.aA3dJ7sMtirNFjK9rucW09MDq6U8Mkmsl6FNDY4DzRI" http://localhost:3001/users
